Modify the products folder 
It's a bad practice to have multiple files for different categories, rather create a reusable component 
using ephemeral state such as; props to pass required properties. 
E.g Check Products.js && ProductItem.js files for guides. 

You can delete the created folder afterwards when concept has been fully grasped. 

To fix the cart issues, store cart item by using the customer userId created.
The array might look like this: 

[{ 
    userId: 1234, 
    cartItem: [{ 
        category: appliances, 
    }]
}]

The illustration above is just a sample
